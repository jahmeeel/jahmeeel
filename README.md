# Hi, my name is Jahmeel! :wave:

I'm a sonographer with a passion for learning and connecting with the coding community. Recently, I've become interested in **Fullstack development** and I'm learning **HTML & CSS (eventually JavaScript)** to expand my skills.

As a **Registered Vascular Technologist**, I've developed a **keen eye for detail** and **problem-solving skills** that I'm applying to and continuing to learn in my coding journey. I believe the analytical and critical thinking skills I've developed in my field will serve me well as I explore new technologies and build new projects.

I'm excited to be part of the coding community and to collaborate with others on innovative projects that can make a difference in the world. Feel free to reach out to me to chat about anything related to Sonography, Gaming, or Fullstack development - *I'm always eager to learn and connect with others!*
